# APIcurious

This project focuses on consuming and working with data from public APIs. I selected Github's API and re-constructed a simplified version of the websiteâ€™s existing UI for a logged-in user using their own API.

APIcurious can be found [here](https://pure-island-57732.herokuapp.com/) live on Heroku.
